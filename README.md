# University of Guelph's (unofficial) Master's Thesis Template

Whilst completing my Master's at the University of Guelph I found no boilerplate LaTeX template to work off of. Hence, I am leaving my template here in the hopes that it might help someone. Cheers!

I have made reasonable efforts to ensure that template is according to the latest official guidelines mentioned on the Graduate and Postdoctoral Studies's page for '[Preparation of your Thesis](https://www.uoguelph.ca/graduatestudies/current-students/preparation-your-thesis)'.
